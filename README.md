# UCI Adult Data Pipeline

This repository contains a detailed data pipeline, built in a Jupyter Notebook, focusing on the UCI Adult dataset. The pipeline encompasses data fetching, cleaning, transformation, storage, and querying.

## Overview

The UCI Adult dataset, often referred to as the "Census Income" dataset, originates from the 1994 Census bureau database. The primary objective with this dataset is predicting whether an individual earns more than $50,000 a year based on various demographic variables.

The data pipeline we've constructed serves as both a tutorial and a practical approach to handling this dataset.

## Features

1. **Data Fetching**: Directly retrieves the dataset from the UCI repository.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Addresses missing values, outliers, and any discrepancies in the dataset.
3. **Data Transformation**: Modifies and transforms the data to be more suitable for analysis.
4. **Data Storage**: Utilizes SQLite to store the processed data, allowing for efficient querying.
